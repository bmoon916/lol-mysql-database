Why create this project?
I wanted to create something with the new knowledge I'm gaining from studying. I thought I would make a database about LOL since I enjoy watching esports. While this is a simple project, I wish to keep on learning to more complex projects in the future. I wish to dive into other skill sets to become a data engineer.
