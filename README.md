LOL MSI 2022 MySQL database 

What is LOL?
League of legends(LOL) is a video game, which pin two groups of five people with their own roles against each other in an arena. The map of the game has three lanes that go through the map with the space between the lanes being called jungle, and is divided into two territories. The two territories are called blue side and red side, in sports terms, Blue side would be home and Red side would be away. The sides are also color coded in blue and red in the game to make a distinction between the two sides. The teams need to fight to reach each others nexus because the game doesn't end until one team destroys the others Nexus.

Why create this project?
I wanted to create something with the new knowledge I'm gaining from studying. I thought I would make a database about LOL since I enjoy watching esports. While this is a simple project, I wish to keep on learning to more complex projects in the future. I wish to dive into other skill sets to become a data engineer. 

What does the database comprise of?
The database has all the matches played, players in each team, and the stats of each player for every match. Using this data, I can look at the top performers, make comparsions
